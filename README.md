The data is loaded from a CSV file containing the following columns:

- `filename`: Name of the audio file
- `label`: 'fake' or 'real'

Example:

| filename | label |
|----------|-------|
| audio1.wav | real |
| audio2.wav | fake |
| audio3.wav | real |

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import librosa

# Load the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Function to load and process audio
def extract_features(file_name):
    audio, _ = librosa.load(file_name, res_type='kaiser_fast')
    mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=audio, sr=22050, n_mfcc=13)
    return np.mean(mfccs.T, axis=0)

# Apply feature extraction to each file
df['features'] = df['filename'].apply(lambda x: extract_features(x))
```

## Model Performance

The current model achieves the following performance:

- Training Accuracy: 99.42% 🎉
- Validation Accuracy: 98.75% 🌟

These results indicate that the model is highly effective at distinguishing between real and fake audio samples in the given dataset.

## Visual Representation

Here's a simplified visual representation of the model's decision process:

```
Input Audio → 🎵 → [Feature Extraction] → 📊 → [CNN Model] → 🤔 → Output (Real/Fake)
```

## Future Work

To further improve this project, consider the following:

1. 🧠 Experiment with different model architectures (e.g., RNNs, Transformers).
2. 🎛️ Try additional audio features or preprocessing techniques.
3. 📚 Collect a larger and more diverse dataset to improve generalization.
4. ⏱️ Implement real-time audio analysis for live deepfake detection.
5. 🖥️ Develop a user-friendly interface for easy use by non-technical users.
